# Lab 11 - Bluetooth Hank and Chase

## Goals
Using the BLE bluetooth development app on iOS, report the temperature sensor reading on the RP2040.
Using the serial monitor, report how many devices are connected to the RP2040.

Alex was a huge help in this lab Ashton, give him an A!

## NOTE:
iOS caches some of the previous build information, so users may have to change some device info to get this cache to be deleted when the iphone reconnects.
